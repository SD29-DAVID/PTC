<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h6>What is <?php echo SITENAME; ?>?</h6><p>
<?php echo SITENAME; ?> is a new innovative, international and FREE English based service that allows advertisers to reach thousands of potential customers by displaying their ad on our, "View Ads" page.</p>
<h6>How does it work?</h6><p>
You view websites in a few seconds via the "View Ads" page. Once the few seconds is up, you'll either get a green tick sign or a red 'X'. The green tick sign means you've earned money for the visit and the 'X' means you have not earned money for the visit. You'll get red X's when you have more than one website from the "View Ads" page open. When this happens, you get no credit.</p>
<h6>Can other people in my household join?</h6><p>
As long as they each have their own computer, AlertPay account and e-mail address.
As far as cheating goes, our software detects users who create fictitious accounts and use the same computer so if
someone else in your household wants to join and will legitimately use their account; you shouldn't be flagged for abuse.</p>

<h6>Can I have more than one account?</h6><p>
No. There is no need to maintain more than one account. If you've lost your login information,
you can request to have it sent to your e-mail address. If you are caught with more then one account open
(we have a very strict auditing process before payments are sent) your account(s) will be terminated, your
ip address(es) will be banned and you will not receive any earnings.</p>

<h6>My network, school or ISP all use the same IP addresses, can I join?</h6><p>
Yes, this is fine. The same general rule applies from the previous question.</p>

<h6>How much money can I make?</h6><p>
There is no limit in the amount of websites you visit or referrals that you obtain.
Your earning possibilities are virtually endless.</p>

<h6>How do I refer others?</h6><p>
Use your unique referral code found within the user area "My Stats".</p>

<h6>I can't see any ads!</h6><p>
If you see no ad links on the "View Ads" page but you DO see stats on the right hand side then you need to
disable all antivirus and antispyware/adware programs. If this doesn't work, try cleaning your cache, temp files,
cookies, etc. If you're still having problems after all of that, try changing or updating your browser.</p>

<h6>My stats aren't updating!</h6><p>
This is either because your browser is saving the page in it's cache or you're not waiting for the dollar sign
to appear after the timer is complete. Try cleaning your cache, temp files, cookies, etc. If you're still
having problems after all of that, try changing or updating your browser.</p>

<h6>I keep getting "Invalid code entered." when I try to register or login!</h6><p>
First, make sure you are correctly typing in the verification code. If you are typing in the correct code and
still having problems then it's something to do with your browser caching the previously used session image.
Try cleaning your cache, temp files, cookies, etc. If you're still having problems after all of that, try changing
or updating your browser. </p>

<h6>How often are the statistics updated?</h6><p>
Stats are updated immediately. </p>

<h6>How do I get paid?</h6><p>
If you have the minimum amount accumulated, you can click on your account balance within your stats area and it will
submit your request. Currently, we only make payments via AlertPay. We will soon be using other methods of payment.</p>

<h6>When do I get paid?</h6><p>
You can request for payment once you're account balance is the minimum amount accumulated. Your payment will be
processed and issued via AlertPay within 7 business days or less.</p>

<h6>What is AlertPay?</h6><p>
AlertPay is the payment processing solution that we use to pay members. Your AlertPay address is the e-mail address
you use to register with AlertPay. You can get a free AlertPay account at <a href="http://www.alertpay.com" target="_blank">www.alertpay.com</a>.</p>

<h6>Why did I get paid less then what I was owed?</h6><p>
If you have a business account with AlertPay, they charge a 2.9% transfer fee plus an additional $0.30 base fee
when you receive funds.</p>

<h6>How can I cancel my account?</h6><p>
Inactive accounts are automatically cancelled after certain time.</p>

<h6>Why I have to click twice to see the green tick?</h6><p>
Check your antivirus, antispyware/adware programs, your browser settings for cookies and java script acceptance.
If this doesn't work, try cleaning your cache or reboot your computer.</p>
